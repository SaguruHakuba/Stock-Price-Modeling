# Stock-Price-Modeling
A computational modeling project on stock market price modeling, prediction and portfolio.

Worked with Logan Caldwell and Owen Land.

Since the stocks we picked from Nasdaq did not have additional stock issue tailed, we did not take directional private placement into consideration in our model.
